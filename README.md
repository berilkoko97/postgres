# Project:Data Modelling With Postgres

## Overview

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app

## Datasets

Song Dataset- The first dataset is a subset  from the Million Song Dataset. 
```
{
num_songs:1
artist_id:"ARKRRTF1187B9984DA"
artist_latitude:null
artist_longitude:null
artist_location:""
artist_name:"Sonora Santanera"
song_id:"SOXVLOJ12AB0189215"
title:"Amor De Cabaret"
duration:177.47546
year:0
}
```

Log Dataset - consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

```
{
  "artist": "Survivor",
  "auth": "Logged In",
  "firstName": "Jayden",
  "gender": "M",
  "itemInSession": 0,
  "lastName": "Fox",
  "length": 245.36771,
  "level": "free",
  "location": "New Orleans-Metairie, LA",

}

```
## SCHEMA
star schema has been used to optimize queries on song play analysis 

### Fact Table 
1.songplays - records in log data associated with song plays
```
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
```
### Dimension Tables.
2.users - users in the app
```
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
```
3.songs - songs in music database
```
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
```
4.artists - artists in music database
```
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
```
5.time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
```
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
```
### Project Files:

- ```data```: Contains two sub-folders song_data and log_data. Under each sub-folders, the sample JSON files are present. 
- ```create_tables.py```: drops and creates tables
- ```etl.ipynb``` :contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables. 
- ```etl.py```: reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into tables 
- ```sql_queries.py``` :contains all your sql queries

## Environment
- Python 3.6 or above
- PostgresSQL 9.5 or above
- psycopg2 

## How to run
You will not be able to ```run test.ipynb```, ```etl.ipynb```, or ```etl.py``` until you have run ```create_tables.py``` at least once to create the sparkifydb database, which these other files connect to.
